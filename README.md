theWalkingDeadSurvivalLockBox
=============================

Using an Arduino Uno, a servo, a few led's and a Sparkfun FPS scanner, you can 
create a customized lock box that recognizes your unique finger print.

Materials List:

1 - Arduino Uno

1 - Small breadboard

12 - Jumperwires

1 - Standard 5V Servo

1 - Sparkfun Fingerprint Scanner - TTL (GT-511C3)

1 - JST SH Jumper 4 Wire Assembly - 8"

1 - Small red LED

1 - Small green LED

1 - 9V Battery with connecting cable to Arduino Uno 

(This is for prototyping purposes. DONT RUN OUT OF BETTERY WITH LOCK ENGAGED!)

2 - 1k ohm resistors

3 - Velcro Peices or sticky wall tack

1 - Old metal/tin box of any kind

3 - 1/4 thick alluminum to build a latch for the servo lock to engage
