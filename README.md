theWalkingDeadSurvivalLockBox
=============================
Using an Arduino Uno, a servo, a few led's and a Sparkfun FPS scanner, you can 
create a customized lock box that recognizes your unique finger print.

    Simple Steps:

The materials list is below and schematic is in the repository. Once the library 
in the repo is added to your Arduino IDE, upload the example sketch "FPS Enroll". 
Once uploaded to the board and the FPS scanner is connected, open the serial 
monitorand follow the serial.Print commonads. They will prompt you to press down 
the same finger 3 consecutive time. Once the enroll is successful, you can upload
the "FPS Id" sketch to your board and watch the magic happen. Control anything
from it really.

Have fun, let me know if you found this repo helpful and share with me 
(and the world) what you make.



    Materials List:

1 - Arduino Uno

1 - Small breadboard

12 - Jumperwires

1 - Standard 5V Servo

1 - Sparkfun Fingerprint Scanner - TTL (GT-511C3)

1 - JST SH Jumper 4 Wire Assembly - 8"

1 - Small red LED

1 - Small green LED

1 - 9V Battery with connecting cable to Arduino Uno 

    (This is for prototyping purposes. DONT RUN OUT OF BETTERY WITH LOCK ENGAGED!)

2 - 1k ohm resistors

3 - Velcro Peices or sticky wall tack

1 - Old metal/tin box of any kind

3 - 1/4 thick alluminum to build a latch for the servo lock to engage
